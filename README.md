## üìã Features

On the page "Idade" (Age) the program receives the user's birth date via a date input field and then when submitted:
- calculates how old the user is (in years, months and days) by comparing the birth date with today's date.
- shows what day of the week the person was born on.
- shows the user's zodiac sign based on the Western horoscope.
- displays a "Happy Birthday" message when the user is completing another year of life at this very day.

The main idiom used is Brazilian Portuguese, my mother language.
